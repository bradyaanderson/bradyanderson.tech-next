const aboutText = `Hey, I'm Brady and this is the part where I talk about myself. I'm a programmer. It's my day job and also something I like to do for fun. That's probably something most programmers can relate to.

I grew up in Illinois, but I went to college in Louisiana at Louisiana Tech University. I got my degree in computer science and moved to Kansas City, Missouri.

One of the great things about being a programmer is that you can essentially work in whatever field you want. So far I've worked as a programmer in the banking, insurance, aerospace, marketing, and medical records fields. Even something as boring-sounding as insurance gets a lot more interesting when you are tackling problems from a programming perspective.

When I'm not working, video games, reading, running; and of course; more programming keep me occupied. I also have a dog, Indy, who you can see pictured with me above.

I find myself bouncing between different interests a lot, but one consistent love of mine is retro hardware. It started with old home video game consoles. Soon enough, I had collected most of the more popular (and cheaper) consoles through history and moved onto retro computers. I think it's the simplicity of the hardware, yet complexity (at least compared to a lot of programming today) that fascinates me.

So that's about it for now. I'll drop a few links below of other places you can find me. Thanks for dropping by!`;
