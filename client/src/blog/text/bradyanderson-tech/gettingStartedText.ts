  open: `For the most part, this is a retroactive account of the technologies I used to build this website. I intended to write my first blog post on June 17th, the day I made my first commit. That didn't quite happen as life got in the way and it took me a bit longer than expected to set up the skeleton of this website. Things are far from perfect, but I started. I guess that's the important part. Anyway, let's go through some of what I used to create this site:`,
  react: `The first version of bradyanderson.tech didn't use a front-end framework. That's the main reason I decided to nuke that old website and start from scratch. I chose to use React for the front-end. The main reason for this is because I use React for my job so I know how to use it pretty well. But also, I just really like React. I love how it pairs JavaScript and HTML so seamlessly. Writing React code just feels natural when you're already used to coding for the web.`,
  express: `Node.js with Express is awesome. It's not a blazingly fast back-end framework, but it lets me use the same programming language for both the front-end and back-end? Up to this point, all of the content on this website is static, so I don't actually need a back-end right now. But maybe I will sometime soon! I thought it was better to structure the project as though it had a back-end for now. If my needs change, I should be able to easily replace this Express backend with something else.`,
  typescript: `Sometimes I wonder how I ever wrote websites using JavaScript instead of TypeScript. Yeah, it takes a little bit of extra work to get things set up and you'll have to type a little bit of extra code, but being able to type-check my code has saved me from so many mistakes. Because of that, I'm writing the front-end and back-end using TypeScript.`,
  heroku: `I should admit that I don't know much about hosting. However, I know that is Heroku makes it unbelievably simple to get your code out to the web through its command-line interface. Also, because so few people will probably be looking at this site, it's essentially free. I hosted my old site on Heroku for years and never paid a cent, yet it was reliable enough that I never had to worry about my website being inaccessible.`,
